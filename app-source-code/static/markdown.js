`#The Perfect Fifth 

In Western music the interval of the Perfect Fifth can can be compared to the Golden Ratio (or golden mean) of mathematics.
Just as the Golden Ratio is found throughout the natural world, the visual arts, and architecture, the Perfect Fifth is found throughout Western Music.
Concepts of scales, keys and key signatures, and harmonic functions (movement from one chord to another) are best understood as variations on the pattern of perfect fifths.

The Perfect Fifth is a relationship between two pitches, one lower and one higher, related to each other in a simple 3 to 3 ratio.
For every two vibrations of the lower pitch, the upper pitch vibrates three times.
In other words, if you play a perfect fifth with the notes G and D on a violin, every two vibrations of the lower string (G) would occur in the same time frame as three vibrations of the upper string (D).
This 3/2 relationship is the simplest, and therefore strongest, relationship between two different notes.`;

`#Musical Gravity

Because of the strength of the 3/2 relationship, the Perfect Fifth plays a key role in determining a sense of musical orientation, or “Gravity.”
For example, playing a G followed by a D creates tension, while moving in the opposite direction (D followed by G) releases that tension and creates a sense of rest or arrival.
Thus we can say that the “gravity” of D is to move towards G.
In like manner, G has musical gravity to C, and C to F. In fact every pitch has this property, as shown below:

D# -> G# -> C# -> F# -> B -> E -> A -> D -> G -> C -> F -> Bb -> Eb -> Ab -> Db -> Gb etc...`;

`#3 Rules for Chords

1. A chord is a combination of 3 or more notes played simultaneously .
2. A chord is typically built by stacking 3rds above a root note.
3. Once built, the stack can be inverted.

The Root Note is the note that gives the chord its name.
For example, the note C is the root of a C Major chord, and the note D in the root of a D minor chord.`;

`#Enharmonic Equivalents

Enharmonic equivalents are notes that are spelled differently but sound the same.
For example, there is only one note between E and D.
This note is lower than E, and it is higher than D.
Thus it can be spelled as (or written, or called) either Eb or D#, and regardless of how it is spelled it sounds the same.
Eb and D# are thus enharmonic equivalents.
The most common enharmonic equivalents are:

F#=Gb  C#=Db  G#=Ab  D#=Eb  A#=Bb`;
